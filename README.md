# shopping cart

Shopping cart page from The Odin Project

Cart feature is fully functional and uses context to provide access to each component.

Each page is its own component rendered using the BrowserRouter from react-router-dom.

You are able to add the same item to the cart multiple times, but every instance of that item is accounted for in the totals on the cart page. If you add more than one of the same item and attempt to delete one from your cart, it will delete them all as if you had added a quantity greater than one a single time.
